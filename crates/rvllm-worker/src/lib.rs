#![cfg_attr(not(feature = "cuda"), forbid(unsafe_code))]
//! Single-GPU worker execution context for vllm-rs.
//!
//! Provides the `Worker` type that owns a model runner, KV cache engine, and
//! GPU stream for a single device. The worker receives `WorkerInput` from the
//! executor, applies cache operations, runs the forward pass, samples tokens,
//! and returns `WorkerOutput`.
