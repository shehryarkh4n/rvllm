//! rvllm-loader: HF safetensors → GPU, with FP8 quant at load.
//!
//! The invariants:
//! - Weights are stored in typed fields, not parallel Vecs indexed by
//!   integer (v2's frequent desync source).
//! - FP8 per-tensor quant runs the clamp-% gate; a tensor exceeding
//!   10 ppm clamp rate returns `LoaderError::Fp8MisScaled` — the model
//!   is mis-scaled, not a viable FP8 candidate, and the engine refuses
//!   to proceed.
//! - Full weight set resident before first forward; no lazy loading.
