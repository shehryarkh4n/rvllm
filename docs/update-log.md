## 2026-03-28: Phase 4 -- CUDA Graph Capture/Replay

**Problem:** Graph capture failed with `CUDA_ERROR_STREAM_CAPTURE_UNSUPPORTED`.

**Root causes found (3):**
1. `context.default_stream()` -- the legacy CUDA stream doesn't support `cuStreamBeginCapture`. Fixed: `context.new_stream()`.
2. cuBLAS workspace -- cuBLAS internally calls `cudaMalloc` during capture. Fixed: pre-allocate 4MB workspace via `cublasSetWorkspace_v2`.
3. cudarc event tracking -- per-CudaSlice read/write events create cross-phase dependencies during capture. Fixed: `disable_event_tracking()`.

**Result:** Graph capture working end-to-end on A100. Full decode forward pass (28 layers) captured as single replayable graph.

**Benchmark (A100 80GB, Qwen2.5-1.5B, f16, greedy):**
| N | tok/s |
|---|---|
| 1 | 128 |
| 4 | 540 |
| 8 | 1,091 |
| 16 | 2,118 |
| 32 | 3,467 |

Per-token: 7.7ms. Overhead: 77% (5.95ms of 7.7ms is not compute).

## 2026-03-28: Phase 5 -- 10-Agent Overhead Reduction Swarm

**Problem:** 5.95ms overhead per token. Breakdown:
- 392 unnecessary f32<->f16 cast kernels per forward
- Separate add+norm (56 extra kernel launches)
- RoPE allocates + copies (56 allocs + 56 memcpy)
- 6 separate metadata HtoD uploads
- tokio yield_now every iteration
- Hot-path info! logging

**10 agents launched in parallel worktrees:**
1. cuBLAS GemmEx mixed-precision GEMM
2. forward_mixed (1-alloc GEMM, no output cast)
3. In-place RoPE (zero alloc, zero copy)
4. Fused residual+RMSNorm (wire existing kernel)
5. Wire forward_mixed into all 7 linear calls
6. Packed metadata upload (6 HtoD -> 1)
7. Engine loop (periodic yield_now every 64 steps)
8. Scheduler (defer tokenizer.decode, reduce cloning)
9. Input prep (DecodeInputScratch with buffer reuse)
10. Graph capture fix (infinite retry bug, logging downgrade)

**Result:** 7.7ms -> 5.75ms per token (-25%).

| N | tok/s |
|---|---|
| 1 | 174 |
| 32 | 4,276 |

## 2026-03-28: Shared Input Casts

**Problem:** forward_mixed casts the same f32 input to f16 redundantly for Q/K/V (3x) and gate/up (2x).

**Fix:** Cast once, share across projections using `forward_f16_in`.

**Result:** 5.75ms -> 5.65ms (-1.8%).

---

## 2026-03-28: Fused QKV and Gate+Up Weights

**Problem:** 3 separate cuBLAS calls for Q/K/V, 2 for gate/up. Each has ~15us dispatch overhead.

**Fix:** Concatenate weights at load time. Single GEMM for QKV (1536+256+256=2048 output), single GEMM for gate+up (8960*2=17920 output). Zero-copy split via CudaView slices.

**Result:** 5.65ms -> 5.55ms. 84 fewer cuBLAS calls per forward.

---

## 2026-03-28: Full f16 Forward (Zero Casts)

**Problem:** 4 remaining f32->f16 cast kernels per layer (112 total). Hidden states bounced between f32 (for element-wise ops) and f16 (for GEMMs).

**Fix:** Complete f16 forward path. All kernels use f16 variants:
- `rms_norm_f16_kernel`, `rotary_embedding_f16_kernel`
- `flash_attention_2_decode_f16io_kernel` (new: f16 Q/output)
- `fused_residual_rmsnorm_f16_kernel`, `fused_silu_mul_f16_kernel`
- `add_f16_kernel`, `add_bias_f16_kernel`
- `reshape_and_cache_f16io_kernel` (f16 K/V input)
- `hgemm` f16xf16->f16 for all projections

Pre-converted norm weights, biases, and embedding table to f16 at load time. Zero cast kernels in the decode inner loop.

**Result:** 5.55ms -> 4.93ms (-11.2%). 200 tok/s at N=1.

---

## 2026-03-28: Timing Instrumentation Reveals Truth

Added per-step timing to the decode loop. **Key finding:**

```
upload_metadata:    2us   (basically free after packed upload)
graph_replay:     750us   (kernel dispatch)
read_graph_output: 4172us (GPU compute + sync wait)
```

The 4.2ms "read" is NOT transfer time (4 bytes). It's **waiting for GPU compute to finish**. The `clone_dtoh` synchronizes the stream, blocking until the graph replay completes.

**Conclusion:** CPU overhead is solved (~0.5ms). The remaining time is GPU kernel efficiency. The theoretical memory-bandwidth floor is 1.3ms (2.6GB weights at 2039 GB/s).

---

## 2026-03-29: 9-Agent Kernel Efficiency Swarm

**Problem:** 2.9ms gap between GPU compute (4.2ms) and theoretical floor (1.3ms). Sources: cuBLAS per-call overhead, memset kernels from alloc_zeros, separate add+norm across layers.

**9 agents:**

cuBLAS launch overhead:
1. `hgemv_f16` for M=1 decode (lower dispatch than GEMM)
2. `hgemm_strided_batched` for multi-GEMM batching
3. `warmup_gemm_shapes` to pre-warm cuBLAS algo cache

Small kernel overhead:
4. In-place `rms_norm_f16` (zero alloc via shared memory)
5. Cross-layer add+norm fusion (fuse last layer's residual add into next layer's norm)
6. Replace `alloc_zeros` with `unsafe { alloc }` for immediately-overwritten buffers

Memory pool overhead:
7. `F16LayerScratch` struct (2.3MB, reusable across layers)
8. CUDA memory pool `CU_MEMPOOL_ATTR_RELEASE_THRESHOLD = u64::MAX`
9. Allocation audit (10 allocs/layer, 5 reusable)

**Result:** 4.93ms -> 4.21ms per token (-14.6%). Graph replay: 750us -> 95us (-87%).

| N | tok/s |
|---|---|
| 1 | 236 |
| 4 | 834 |
| 8 | 1,786 |
| 32 | 5,123 |

## 2026-03-29: Custom GEMV + cublasLt + Async DtoH Pipeline

### Custom GEMV kernel
Wrote `gemv_f16_kernel` with half2 vectorized loads, warp shuffle reduction, f32 accumulation. Result: **no improvement over cuBLAS** (4205us vs 4205us). cuBLAS's internal M=1 dispatch is already efficient. The 4.1ms is genuine GPU memory bandwidth time.

### cublasLt for decode GEMMs
Wired `CublasLtOps::hgemm_a_bt` with split-K for M<=32. Result: **marginal** (~7us, 4212->4205us). CUDA graph bakes the kernel at capture time; algorithm selection is one-shot.

### Async DtoH pipeline
Added pinned host memory DtoH path. Graph replay + async DtoH enqueue returns in **60us** (was 4212us blocking). Forward call is now non-blocking.

### Engine-level pipeline (attempted, reverted)
Tried overlapping GPU compute with next step's prepare_step. **Catastrophic at high N**: 1787->154 tok/s at N=16. Root cause: the scheduler needs ALL tokens from step N before scheduling step N+1. Pipelined step delays token delivery, causing the scheduler to re-schedule same sequences without latest tokens.

**Correct pipeline approach**: overlap GPU compute with new request arrival processing at the async engine level, not same-sequence scheduling. Future work.

### Key finding
The 4.1ms per token is the **hardware efficiency floor** for Qwen2.5-1.5B on A100. Weight reads dominate: 3.09GB at ~75% memory bandwidth utilization. Custom kernels, cublasLt, and algorithm tuning all converge to the same number. Further gains require:
- Smaller models (fewer weights to read)
- Quantization (INT8/FP8 halves weight reads)
- Multi-GPU (parallel weight reads)
- Speculative decoding (amortize weight reads across multiple tokens)
